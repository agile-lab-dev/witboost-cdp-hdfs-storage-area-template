This repository is part of our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) meant to showcase witboost's integration capabilities and provide a "batteries-included" product.

# HDFS Storage Area Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to create a HDFS path within a CDP Private instance.

We will need to create all paths that contain the data that will be used for the Data Product, especially the final table the Output Port will use to build the view exposed to the public.

Refer to the [witboost Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) for information on the Specific Provisioner that can be used to deploy components created with this template.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's a Storage Area?

A Storage Area is what the components of a Data Product use to persist data that is created or used by the various Workloads or served by Output Ports.

## Usage

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).

### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the Data Product, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for [HDFS Storage Area](./policies/storagearea.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview).
